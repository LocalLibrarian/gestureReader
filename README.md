# Gesture Reader
## Description
This is a personal project I made that allows the user to run a Python program that reads hand gestures from a live feed of a video camera. The program performs different actions based on the gestures it reads.
## Requirements
Python, libraries: MediaPipe, CV2
## How to Use
Run the .py file. Change the settings to your liking and then click "Start". You can refer to the Main Menu settings to see which actions are controlled by which gestures. Perform the gestures in front of the camera and they will take effect.
## Future Improvements
- Performance improvements, if possible.
